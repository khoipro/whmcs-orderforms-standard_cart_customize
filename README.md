# WHMCS Order Form - Standard Cart (Better User Experience)
A better user experience for WHMCS order form theme called 'standard_cart'. Made with [heart] by Khoi Nguyen.

I really don't know why WHMCS Staff team release a WHMCS theme called 'standard_cart' which seem good with Bootstrap framework, but some elements seems not good enough for user experience. From my side I wish to make change, and here you can find a better user experience with this theme.

NOTICE: I made a custom css to this theme and some tweak setting for .tpl file, so please backup your current standard_cart folder BEFORE.

Thank you,
